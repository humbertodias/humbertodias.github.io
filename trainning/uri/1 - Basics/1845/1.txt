Hey, little train! We are all fumfing on
The train that goe to the kingdom.
We're haffy, ma, we're hafing fun,
And the train ain't efen left the tation.

Hey, little train! Wait for me!

Hey, little train! Wait for me!
I wa held in chain fut now I'm free.
I'm hanging in there, don't you ee,
In thi froce of elimination.

Hey, little train! We are all fumfing on
The train that goe to the kingdom.
We're haffy, ma, we're hafing fun.
It' feyond my wildet effectation.
